                <h4>Discomfort Means You <em>are</em> Learning</h4>

                <p> Chris Voss, the famous hostage negotiator, always says that when you are practicing a new skill and feel awkwardness or discomfort, it's a good thing&mdash;it means you are learning. 
                    Learning HTML, CSS, and git is no different. Your brain has not figured out how to connect the information yet, so it feels slow, and you start questioning if you will ever get this. 
                    Then one day, it clicks, and the very thing giving you trouble a couple of weeks ago is coming more easily now. You have to push through and <strong>keep going</strong>!
