                    <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                </div>

                <div class ="half-width">

                    <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                    <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>


                    <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class = "full-width">

                    <h4> Giving advice on a topic helps the learner understand. </h4>
                    <p> 1.Follow the instructions carefully. 2. Make bookmark links easily accessible and organise your files correctly. 3. Do not forget to use a wide range of resources on the web and the links provided.
                    4. Keep going, try out different tags in editors, use a code validator and reread the material you have.
                    5. Whilst coding, double-check for typos and reread any cheatsheets you have. 6. Once learnt, try to remember by creating new code. 7. If stuck, find a solution code, and work backwards from there, learning each command. 8. Ask Skillcrush.
