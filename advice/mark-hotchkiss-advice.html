            <div class="advice">

                <p>I was in the Navy, a lifetime ago, and I went through the Nuclear Power Program. I was only 20 years old,
                    so obviously, I had no previous training to operate and repair a nuclear reactor. I learned to take great
                    notes and to refer back to them every day, until I had commited them to memory. The program was only a 6 
                    month school, so you can imagine the amount of information I had to retain in a short period of time.
                </p>
                <h4>Look back on what you have learned.</h4>
                <p>Learning would not be complete without looking back and assessing what you have learned. This all starts 
                    with taking notes. This is extremely important â€” I cannot stress this point enough. Taking notes is how 
                    I keep track of the things I have learned and it allows me to have a great reference point to go back to 
                    when I get stuck.</p>

                <p>I also found that it is important to schedule time to look over your notes and see whether you remember 
                    the material that you have learned.</p>

                <h4>My most important advice.</h4>
                <p>Do not try to memorize everything ... instead ... learn to understand it!</p>
                
                <p>When you are first starting out learning to code online, take small steps. Start with the basics and try 
                    to <strong>understand the concepts behind the things you are learning</strong> before moving on.</p>
