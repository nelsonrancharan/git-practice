                <h4>Mistakes Help Solidify Your Learning</h4>
                <p>Making errors is an essential part of the learning process. Recognizing that a mistake has been made, and then figuring out how to fix it, can help you avoid making similar mistakes in the future. It also helps you realize that even when you make a mistake, <strong>you have not failed</strong>.</p>

                <p>Mistakes are a vital part of learning, especially in coding, because fixing your errors is a large part of problem solving. And coding is all problem solving. </p>

                <h4>The Goldilocks Rule</h4>
                <p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.
                </p>

                <p>If you're doing things that are just a little bit outside of your comfort zone, you will be experiencing peak motivation, which will make you want to keep going. If you're making mistakes, you know that you're still growing, and learning, which will help motivate you to want to do and learn more!</p>
