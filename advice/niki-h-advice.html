            <h1>Hi, my name is Niki.H and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
                <h4>Keep the Momentum Going</h4>
                <p>When you first start skillcrush you are likely to be excited about starting something new, anticipating 
                    a new fulfulling career, and hopfully making friends along the way. Let that momentum launch you into 
                    the first lesson and even if you don't get far into it, you will have started and that will help you
                    to have momentum the next time you open up Skillcrush. It might wain occasionally but do what you can
                    to set yourself up for a productive session next time.</p>
