                <h4>Learn OOP Principles</h4>
                <p>Nearly all popular modern programming languages are OOP.  <br />
                    Don't overthink <em>"what programming language should I learn?"</em>.   <br />
                    Learn whatever programming language is best for the project you're developing.   <br /> <br />
                    After learning OOP principles you'll realize that most popular modern programming languages are very much alike.  <br /> 
                    It is just a matter of getting used to a programming language's idioms.</p>
