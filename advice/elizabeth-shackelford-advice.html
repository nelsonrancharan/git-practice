        <h4>Confusion is your friend</h4>
        <p>
          When you start programming your first web app you are doing something
          that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new
          opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so
          specific that it's probably never been done before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
          direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving
          pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
          deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.
        </p>

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
          write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
          you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
          you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
          exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.
        </p>

        <h4>Asking for help is an important skill</h4>
        <p>
          As with anything in life, there comes a time when we need to ask for
          help. When learning how to code, it's important to try to figure out
          challenges on your own, but when you're learning or doing something
          new, you will come across a challenge that perhaps you can't fully
          figure out on your own or is confusing to undersand. When this occurs,
          recognizing the need for guidance and clarification is an important
          skill that will enhance your journey in learning how to code.
        </p>

        <h4>Know when to step away and shift gears</h4>
        <p>
          When finding yourself unable to solve a challenge or debug your code,
          sometimes the best thing you can do is simply step away from your
          coding project to recharge. Taking breaks allow you to shift gears,
          giving you a renewed sense of focus and fresh perspective when you
          later retun to your coding challenge. Changing your environment,
          movement, engaging with your creativity, nourishing your mind-body
          connection, and even engaging with others, are great ways to take a
          break and improve memory, motivation, and concentration. Breaks
          defined by such activities help you better face and navigate your
          coding challenge with greater mental clarity and strength.
