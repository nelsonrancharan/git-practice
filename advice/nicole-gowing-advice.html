        <h4>It's okay to not know, what you don't know!</h4>
        <p>
          When you first start coding, its a completely new world you're diving
          into. It may seem as if every new lesson is completely foreign to you,
          that's because it is! Don't worry that you aren't experiencing any
          type of familiarity with the subject matter, or that you feel you
          spend more time trying to comprehend each subject, rather than moving
          forward smoothly. Being forced to further explore the copious internal
          questions you encur, enhances your recall memory on subjects you never
          even knew about before you started.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are struggling to comprehend
          something, and your brain is searching for the answers. It's prompts
          you to look further, to explore more than you even though possible. If
          you don't have questions while you're learning, then are you even
          really learning?
        </p>

        <h4>The Mountain of Wonder.</h4>
        <p>
          When you first start learning something new, like coding, you can feel
          like sometimes you're just going through the motions. Following
          step-by-step, but unsure whether you really understand the whole
          picture. That's because you don't yet, each step gets you closer
          though. Each step is another building block that you continue to
          climb, making that giant mountain of knowledge more attainable. Before
          you know it, you're at the top of the mountain basking in all the
          things you accomplished, in complete awe of the fact that you made it,
          and you hunger for more.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you start a new learning path such as coding or programming,
          remember that you are essentially having to train your brain to
          recognize something new. Just like you would have done as a child in
          school, though it may not have felt the same.
