                <h4>Always Be Learning</h4>
                <p>My late Grandmother was one of the wisest people I know.  She was also
                    the most predictable...pot roast for Sunday lunch, cereal for dinner when the Texas temperature was above 100 (she didn't want to 
                    cook), and Days of Our Lives was always preceeded by The Price is Right
                    (all other times, the t.v. was OFF).  Never a new recipe.  Never a takeout
                    pizza.  Never a documentary on the indegionous people of the Australian Outback.  Just
                    the same old thing week after week.
                </p>

                <p>My wise and beloved Grandmother forgot everything and everyone by the time she was
                    85.  You see, she developed Alzheimers.  Alzheimers is not hereditary in my family.
                    Her problem (in my opinion) was that she failed to keep learning.  Her mind forgot how to make new connections so it 
                    just stopped working.  For the following 16 years, until her passing, she would not remember me, her
                    children, her name, or where she was.    Always Be Learning.
                </p>

                <h4>Get Sleep</h4>
                <p>8 hours of sleep is what most doctors recommend.  Yeah. Right.
                    I have 3 kids, one of whom is a toddler.  Sleep is not easy to come by so it has to
                    be a priority.  I find that when I can get at least 7 hours of sleep, my mind works better.
                    I think those doctors know what they are talking about.
                </p>

                <h4>Wear Sunblock</h4>
                <p>The sun is harmful and melenoma is no joke.  If you have skin, and you sometimes
                    go outside, for the love of all that is holy, wear sunblock!
