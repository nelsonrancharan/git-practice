            <h1>Hi, my name is Chris, and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Peristence is key!</h4>
                <p>Learning how to code is literally learning a new language. As much as the language apps out there would
                lead you to believe, you cannot learn a language in only 10 minutes per day. The 
                best years for language learning are the childhood years, and you are probably an adult.</p>

                <p>But do not give up hope! Coding is easier than learning a foreign language, and daily practice pays 
                off. It is better to do as much as you can every day than it is to skip many days and try to work for 
                24 hours straight on the weekend. Your eyes and legs will thank you.</p>

                <h4>Have reasonable expectations.</h4>
                <p>I have run into several people recently who have wanted to learn a new skill but get extremely 
                frustrated when they are not proficient in it immediately. It is ok to be horrible at something while
                you are still learning, and mistakes are the greatest teachers. The fear of being seen as incompetent
                or weak should not stop you from pursuing your goals.
                </p>

                <p>All good work takes time. Anything worth doing takes effort. There is value in the struggle.</p>
