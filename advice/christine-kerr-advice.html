                <h4>Confusion is your friend.  Yeah, Really!</h4>
                    <p><strong>When you start programming your first web app, you're doing something that you've never done before.</strong></p>

                    <p>It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>  

                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.  It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p><br>

                
                <h4>"Suspended disbelief" plays a more important role than you think</h4>
                    <p><strong>When learning a new technology, you will go through this horrible, uncomfortable phase where you KNOW the code is doing this THING, but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</strong></p>

                    <p>Whether learning how to write your first programming language, (or just the latest framework), this particular pain is something you need to become friends with.  This is a normal but also a very critical part of the learning process.</p>

                    <p>When you encounter a new programming language, you need to re-train your eye. The way to do this is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.  Trust the process and one day confusion will make as much sense as your first natural language.</p><br>


                <h4>Going "Old Skool" when learning Tech</h4>
                    <p><strong>One thing I've learnt to do during my SC studies is to handwrite the instructions.  First I write the instructions onto loose A4 paper, then I write it AGAIN into my A5 GIT notebook.  THEN I type the instructions in my command line.</strong></p>

                    <p> This method IS as slow, painful and tedious as it sounds, but it works.  It's definitely helped me understand Git (and HTML, CSS) better.  I have not, (by any means - yet) managed to memorise the sequence of Git commands (without referring to my notes) but I know that day will come, the more often I use Git.</p>

                    <p>There's something about handwriting that allows you to "see" the syntax better.  Sure, you can re-read the code until your eyes bleed, but it's not the same.  The action of writing makes your brain do something different when comprehending code and the step-by-step process of typing it.</p>

                    <p>So if you're struggling a little with your coding comprehension, why not give this method a go and see if it doesn't help or not.  We may live in a world that is fast and full of copy/paste,but nothing beats understanding what it is, you're actually doing</p><br>


                <h4>Think about your "Why"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Why are you learning to code?</strong> My reasons are:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li> Mostly .... more money</li>
                        <li> Staying professionally relevant </li>
                        <li> The shock of discovering that I actually enjoy it</li>
                        <li> It uses my natural thinking talents and</li>
                        <li> I want to lead by example and show other older deaf/hearing impaired folks that they too are smart enough to learn how to code and have a well paid job.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>What's yours?</p><br>

                <p><strong>Even though I'm new to the world of coding and still don't 100% know where I want to go...</strong></p>

                <p>One of the driving forces within me is my desire to become a Filemaker Developer.
