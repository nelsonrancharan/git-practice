            <h1>Hi, my name is <span>Allison Cormier</span> and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Problem Solving is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you first start coding websites on your own you are going to run into a few problems and even though 
                    we have a lot of helpful people on slack ready to help solve your problem I would recommend trying to
                    solve it yourself first. If you do solve it on you own then you will be so proud of yourself and feel like
                    you can tackle any future problems.
                </p>

                <p>Problem Solving on your own is a helpful tool to get you researching everything you can to fix your code but 
                    don't be afraid to ask for help also because you might just need another set of eyes to see something you don't 
                    and then you will be able to finish up your issue.
                </p>

                <h4>Don't let your frustration take over</h4>
                <p>You are absolutely going to get frustrated when you are learning this fun technology but you can't let it take 
                    over what you are working on. The best thing I've done when I get frustrated is to take a break and come back with 
                    a better attitude. No matter your problem at the moment it can always be solved even if you need to step away.
                </p>

                <p>The most important advice is to have fun and think of all the great things you will be able to accomplish
                    with all your new skills from this course. 
                </p>
