                <h4>Baby steps</h4>
                <p>When you're starting to learn anything new, it can be intimidating to look at how far you still need to go. 
                    It's like looking up a tall mountain when you're at the beginning of a hike.</p>

                <p>So far, I've found that focusing on one small step at a time is a good strategy for learning to code. 
                    Take the time to practice that one HTML tag or CSS property over and over again. 
                    The more you practice it when you're first learning, the better it will stick with you and the less you'll have to think about it the next time you use it.
                </p>

                <p>And just like hiking - if you get tired or frustrated, it's ok to take a break!</p>

                <h4>Check, and check again</h4>
                <p>Code validators (and other tools that help you identify mistakes) are awesome and you should definitely use them. 
                    However, using your own brain and eyes first when you're working on a baby step can help you retain the new information you're learning by solving a problem yourself. 
                    Be detail-oriented and engage your brain!
