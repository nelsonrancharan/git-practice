                <h4>Keep moving forward!</h4>
                <p>Try not to get dicouraged or overly frustrated, especially if you are coming back for a second career.  It's hard to get started in a totally new subject.  Keep coming back, working on the lessons, and studying. </p>

                <p>Don't expect to understand everything right away. It's really easy to think you should understand all of it after one shot/one read-through becuase you are an adult and maybe even have a whole career behind you.  But, remember how long it took you to become an expert in your field and keep that in mind if you are struggling.</p>

                <h4>Keep coming back</h4>
                <p>It might take more than one attempt to fully understand something or "get it right."  And you migth even have to take a break for a while which is fine.  I started this during the pandemic (summer of 2020) hoping to be done by December of that year.  It's spring of 2022 now.  So..you can se how well that worked out.  I started again and this time around it's a little easier.
