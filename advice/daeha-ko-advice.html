                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <h4>Learn by doing!</h4>
                <p>Do not be discouraged if you do not understand everything right away! When you practice by doing, you 
                    will start to understand how all parts of coding fit together. Praise yourself everytime you build 
                    a page that works!</p>
                
                <h4>Take breaks!</h4>
                <p>If you feel stuck, feel free to walk away, take a break or come back to the issue tomorrow. Look at
                    the code with fresh eyes.</p>

                <h4>Ask for help!</h4>
                <p>Your fellow student coders and professionals working in the field are great resources! Don't hesistate
                    to use the skillcrush slack channel. Outside use reddit and substack as examples to ask coding questions!
                    People love to help each other!</p>

                <h4>Last but not least</h4>
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
