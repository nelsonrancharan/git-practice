        <h1>Hi, my name is Camille and I have some advice for you!</h1>
    </header>

        <div class="advice">
            <h4>You're never alone!</h4>
            <p>This is all extremely new to me. I have to constantly remind myself that I don't have to know it all yet,
                but that can be really hard.</p>

            <p>The community Skillcrush has available has made this an incredible experience thus far.</p>

            <h4>It helps to remember WHY I'm doing this.</h4>
            <p>For me, I work in a really toxic work environment, and my mental and phsyical well being rely on me
                getting out of there. Forunately I have found that I LOVE coding and it will prove to be a profitable
                and flexible career change.
            </p>

            <p>Even though I enjoy it, sometimes it's hard and I feel like I'm not learning fast enough. I'm not
                dedicating enough time. I tell myself a lot of stories while I'm wrapped in stress from work and overall
                struggling to budget my time.
            </p>

            <p>All that to say, yes this is hard! AND, that doesn't mean I can't do it! Same goes for you.</p>
