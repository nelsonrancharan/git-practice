        <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
        <p>
          When you start programming your first web app you are doing something
          that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new
          opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so
          specific that it's probably never been done before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
          direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving
          pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
          deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.
        </p>

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
          write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
          you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
          you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
          exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.
        </p>
        <h4>Have fun!</h4>
        <p>
          Don't forget that in coding you have the ability to create totally new
          things that can be for others or just your own. Don't forget to have
          fun with it, even if there are times when you won't immediately
          understand the coursework.
        </p>

        <h4>Take breaks.</h4>
        <p>
          Taking breaks in between lessons and especially when I'm stuck makes a
          huge difference! Get some fresh air or a coffee, listen to music,
          whatever it may be that allows you to refresh.
