        <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
        <p>
          When you start programming your first web app you are doing something
          that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new
          opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so
          specific that it's probably never been done before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
          direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving
          pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
          deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.
        </p>

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
          write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
          you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
          you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
          exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.
        </p>
        <h4 id="focus">Focus on the Fundamentals</h4>
        <p>
          Like in any field, getting a good grasp of the fundamentals is
          critically important to achieving long-term success. The information
          you learn at the beginning of your programming education will allow
          you to grasp the logic of more complicated topics further along. If
          you donâ€™t learn basic computer programming, you could fall behind in
          the future. So, even if the fundamentals seem boring or unimportant at
          first, you need to recognize how essential it is to learn them.
