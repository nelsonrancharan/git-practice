        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>A solid foundation</h4>
                <p>The advice I would have given myself when I just started out coding is, like with any language,
                make sure to get the basics right. And for me that means not only learn to write to code, but learn to read
                just as well.</p>

                <p>In my opinion the reading part can take place on two levels. Level one is the easier or lower or first level. Reading
                  on level one means reading an html document with tags and all the other goodies. Looking at the structure and and so on and also
                looking at the css file. And looking up as much as possible things that are new to you in the html and css documents.</p>

                  <p>And then reading code on level two means: looking at a webpage and replacing all the visual elements on the webpage
                  with tags without putting a single piece of code on paper or in your text editor. Let me give an example. If you have a webpage
                open, than my advice would be to look at the menu for instance and ask questions like: is it on the right or on the left side of the page? Is it a dropdown?
                What color? Is there any text-decoration like underlining? How would I write all these different elements of this menu out in code? Without being to precise.</p>

                <h4>Last but not least</h4>
                <p>Lastly, my advice to myself when I just started out coding is: practice, practice, practice. I'm pretty sure any coder will agree with
                  this advice. It's a no brainer actually. But practice what exactly? I would say to myself as a beginner coder: with what you've learned,
                  make simple websites, like resume pages for friends and family for example. It's very rewarding to see
                  that with a little knowledge of code you can make tangible stuff. And to each new mini project implement something new. To discover new things.
                </p>

                <p>Et voila! That would be my advice to myself. Hopefully it would be helpful to other beginner coders as well.</p>
