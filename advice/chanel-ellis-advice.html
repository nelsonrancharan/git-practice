                <h4>Confused? Good you're supposed to be!</h4>
                <p>As a child, when you were first learning to read, remember how foreign and confusing
                  all those symbols looked on the page? But as you practiced putting sounds together the confusion
                  began to disappear and you were soon reading on your own. Learning to code is no different.
                  Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction</p>


                  <p> Make this your new mantra</p>
                   I Will Stick With It<br>I Won't Be Intimidated<br>I Can Do This<br> </p>

                <h4>And remember...</h4>
                <p>You can't break the machine!!
                </p>
