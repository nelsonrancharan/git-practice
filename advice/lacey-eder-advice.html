                <h4>Practice makes perfect!</h4>
                <p>When starting on the journey to learning how to code in a new language, each new thing you learn, do practice exercises! Repetition will help you to remember what to do, how to fix problems,
                    and be able to identify why a certain piece of code does what it does.</p>
                
                <p>I make good use of the many free tutorials on the Web, like W3 Schools or Free Code Camp! Even when I think I've mastered a topic, I'll still run through some practice exercises to keep it
                    fresh in my mind!
                </p>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>If you're working on a bit of code and find yourself confused and wondering if you made the right choice learning this, don't worry!
                    Even the best, most experienced coders find themselves confused!</p>
                <p>Remember, you're not alone and it's 100% okay to utilize and look back on cheatsheets, tutorials, and the vast amount of resources that are available! We all use them! Don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>
