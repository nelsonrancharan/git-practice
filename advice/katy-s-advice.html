            <h1>Hey! Looking for a bit of advice?</h1>

                <h4>Confusion &amp frustrastion are your friends!</h4>
                <p>When you start doing something that you have never done before, it's hard, 
                    tiring, demanding and incredibly frustrating. On the other hand, it's a new goal, a new challenge, 
                    a new opportunity, and in this case, maybe (hopefully) a new career.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. <strong>Revel in that shit!</strong> 
                    Don't run away even though you know you want to, you must <strong>resist</strong>! It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig <em>deeper</em> and keep going because clarity awaits. [<em>distant choir sounds: ahhhhhhhh!</em> ]</p>

                <h4>Fear &amp; loathing (<em>&amp doubt</em>): lead to sucess!</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, you go through this immensley uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing something. Whatever THIS THING is, well, you don't understand it. It 
                    works but you have no earthly idea HOW?! You pinch yourself, and lo-and-behold, it STILL works! 
                    <strong>You are doing this!</strong> 
                    Wait, what?!
                </p>

                <p>Yes, this is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology (not just for us OCD folks either, 
                    for every "normal" person too). It's also a critical part of the process. (No, seriously.)</p>

                <p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye (or both eyes if you have two). The way to train your eye/s is to read a boat-load of code 
                    even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <p>But wait! There's more!</p>

                <p>Well, not really.  Just make sure you keep on keepin' on! (As if your OCD self could actually quit? HA!)</p>
