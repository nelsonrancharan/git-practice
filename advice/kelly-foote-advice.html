                <h4>Practice, Practice, Practice!</h4>
                <p>The best way to hone your coding skills is to spend as much time as possible practicing!</p>

                <p>If you are a busy parent, like me, get your family on board with your practicing goals. Set a visual goal tracker and allow your children to color it in every time your practice. Bonus points if you have a prize for the whole family when you reach your goal!</p>

                <h4>Don't be afraid to make mistakes!</h4>
                <p>Every mistake you make is an opportunity to learn and grow. If you make a mistake and learn how to fix it, chances are you will 
                    not make that same mistake again. 
                </p>

                <p>When you make mistakes, don't be afraid to ask others for help. People are more willing to help than you would think, so don't hesitate to ask, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. </p>
