                <h4>Don't be afraid to ask for help!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning to code, the whole process can seem overwhelming.  Things sometimes don't work as they are supposed to even though you have double and triple checked your code.  Frustration is part of the learning curve.  Knowing when to ask for help is also part of the curve and brings you into the wider community. You are not alone.</p>

                <p>**Added bonus! Asking for help moves you forward. Return the favor down the line!** </p>

                <h4>Tell yourself "you've got this!" with every step you take</h4>
                <p>Change is hard. We have all had to adapt and to work and learn remotely.   Celebrate each new success along the way, no matter how small.    
                </p>
