                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>HTML tips to remeber!</h4>
            <div class="half-width">
               <h5>Always close your HTML tags</h5>
               <p>This will ensure that you HTML will work properly on all browsers. While there are some tags that don't
                    have a corresponding closing tag, most will, so just be aware of which ones don't.
               </p>
               <h5>Style HTML using style sheets when possible</h5>
               <p>Style sheets make the look of your coding much easier to control and edit when needed.</p>
               <h5>Use an HTML validator</h5>
               <p>Running your web pages through an HTML validator is a great way to catch mistakes in your coding you might
                    have missed. Your pages may appear fine on one browser and fail to work on another. A validatior will catch
                    this for you.
               </p>
            </div>
            <div class="half-width">
                <h5>Use HTML comments wisely</h5>
                <p>Adding comments to your coding can make it much easier to find specific setions and their functions. This also
                   makes it eaiser for others to understand your coding if you are woking with a team.
                </p>
                <h5>Use widths and heights with HTML images</h5>
                <p>It's a good idea to specify the width and height of an image. This allows the browser to format the page faster as it
                    is loaded.
                </p>
                <h5>Don't forget about online resources!</h5>
                <p>If you are ever stuck with your HTML or CSS, remember there are so many outlets online to help you work your way through.
