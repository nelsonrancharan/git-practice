                    <h4>Consume as Much as You Can!</h4>

                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before and you would never do something for the first time without advice. Youtube, Books, Online Resources are there and they really help. Things look so strange but after a while you get to recognise familiarities and becomes much easier. So consume as much as you can and embrace the challenge.</p>

                    <p>Confusion is natural and is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                    <h4>Dont Be Discouraged, Keep Battling Through.</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Starting out, and even after alot of learning, it can feel disheartening. You feel like you'll never get it. But you will. The rush and exhiliration from finally conquering a challenge when youre learning is comparable to "runners high". It feels great and something you'll want to achieve again and again.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                    <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
