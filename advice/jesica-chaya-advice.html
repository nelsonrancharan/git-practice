            <h4>I'm learning a new language, and that takes time and practice!</h4>
            <p>I find it really helpful to recognize the parallel between learning new languages and learning to code.
                It takes
                time, and it feels so uncomfortable at first! You have to look up anything unfamiliar quite a few times
                before it
                really sticks, and just like with learning a language like Spanish, it takes hands on practice - during
                which it's
                A-O-K to not be communicating perfectly! </p>

            <p>Learning from mistakes is what will make the right way forward really
                strick a bit extra!</p>

            <h4>Chip away a little at a time, and big change will come along with time.</h4>
            <p>Just like you can't learn a foreign language overnight, you certainly can't learn how to code overnight
                either! Patience is your best friend, and recognizing those small daily, weekly, and monthly milestones
                will make all the difference when it comes to keeping yourself motivated and inspired to keep pushing
                forward.
