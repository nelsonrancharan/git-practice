                <h4>Believe in yourself.</h4>
                <p>Jumping into somthing new may be easy, but sticking to it is the challenge. Be your #1 supporter through 
                    the journey! There may be lots of doubt along the way, but showing up for yourself makes
                    all the difference.
                </p>

                <h4>Trust the process.</h4>
                <p> We all learn new things in different ways and at different rates. That doesn't make anyone's approach or pace 
                    better or worse. The important thing is to keep going.
                </p>

                <h4>Refresh.</h4>
                <p>Let yourself breathe and step away. Sometimes, you may not be feeling it or you may be mentally
                    overwhelmed with so much new information. Taking a break is not a bad thing. You need it!
