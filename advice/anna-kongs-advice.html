                <h4>Don't let a good challenge keep you down!</h4>
                <p>It's easy to give up on things when you don't understand them. When I was younger, I would easily get frustrated with something and walk away. I look back on things and wish I had stuck with them. Now I know that I get my best learning done with a good challenge!</p>

                <p>Don't tell yourself "I'll never get this." <em>You will get it.</em> You have the resources, the brain power, and a whole program in Skillcrush to back you up and <em>make sure</em> you get it!</p>

                <h4>You can do it!</h4>
                <p>There are literally <em>thousands</em> if not <em>millions</em> of people who are doing the very thing you're doing now. If they can do it, you can do it. Remember learning how to ride a bicycle, learning how to swim, or learning how to read? Remember getting frustrated with it? Look at you now, you bike-riding, pool-swimming, reading and coding wonder! You will get this. Work through it, take your time, and try to be easy on yourself. It's not easy. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth doing.
</p>

                <p>Someday you'll look back and think "I remember doing this in Skillcrush. I thought it was so hard, but now it's second nature." Trust me. It's going to happen one day.</p>

                <p>Repetition and consistency are key. Maybe listen to some podcasts or read some books about coding. Go to a virtual coding meetup. They're all over the place! There's a whole community, if not nearby then definitely online. Your community is out there. There are <em>millions</em> of us. Millions!</p>
