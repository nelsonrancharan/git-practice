            <h1>Hi, I'm Tauri. I have ADHD, and I'm learning professional coding from home! Here's my advice:</h1>
        </header>

        <section>
            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Find a program and a community!</h4>
                <p>A good program, and even better a good community, will challenge you to grow where you might have
                    left holes and they give you the positive feedback you need to keep going.</p>

                <p>Coding may not commonly be referred to as an art, but it's very creative! No two coders will approach
                    the exact same design the same way. And just like with art, it's good to see examples for inspiration
                    and to keep up on the most current trends, which a program and a community will help you with.
                </p>

                <h4>Take what you learn and practice, practice, practice!</h4>
                <p>However you decide to learn coding, whoever is giving you instruction can only give you examples of 
                    how to use techniques and guidance on possible portfolio projects. It's up to you to customize, to
                    combine techniques togethern in your own way, and to show your own personality in your portfolio.
                </p>

                <p>For me this means I have days set asside where instead of learning something new, I'm just practicing
                    and fooling around with what I've learned! It's fun and means you'll be much better than if all you
                did was complete your lessons. </p>
