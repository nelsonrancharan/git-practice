                <h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
                <p>Sometimes things will make no sense at all until you have had a chance to try it yourself. And sometimes, you think it makes sense UNTIL you try it yourself for the first time! Keep trying and remember there are so many ways to code a website!</p>

                <p>The more times you practice the same thing, the easier it gets. Sometimes things really click after you have done it a few times.</p>

                <h4>Taking notes helps a lot.</h4>
                <p>I love taking notes and being sure to highlight the important things that I know will come up frequently so I can easily refer back.
                </p>

                <p>Organizing my notes by topic has helped me be able to easily flip right to what I need when I am stuck.</p>
